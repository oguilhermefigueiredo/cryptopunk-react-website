### How to use

1. First, you need to active an extension called "Moesif", to make sure that you'll not be blocked by CORS licence.

2. Then you need to disable your Adblock, because I'm using a free database based on another site, so I don't have all the rights to the content.

3. You can access the domain by clicking on this link: https://cryptopunk-react-website.vercel.app/
